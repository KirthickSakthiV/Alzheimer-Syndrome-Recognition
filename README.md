# Alzheimer Syndrome Recognition using Deep Learning with ResNet and Dense Algorithm
         - Alzheimer Syndrome Recognition using Deep Learning Approaches and Convolutional Neural Networks play a crucial role in Alzheimer's Syndrome diagnosis through MRI scan analysis. By utilizing a pre-trained ResNet & Dense model, it classifies brain scans into four categories: Non-Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented.
